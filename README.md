# Atomic Turtle

**Atomic Turtle** is a CLI tool designed to streamline the implementation of a premade atomic design structure in various languages and frameworks. It can serve as a foundation for building your own atomic design library or be used as a starting point for projects.

## Features

- **Atomic Design Structure**: Atomic Turtle provides a predefined atomic design structure consisting of atoms, molecules, and organisms.

- **Multi-language Support**: Easily implement the atomic design structure in different languages such as JavaScript (js), TypeScript (ts), or Vue.js (vue).
